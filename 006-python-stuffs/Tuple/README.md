## Are you sure that you tame it? Look at these example and try to infer which one is tuple
```python
# 1
a = (1, 2)
type(a)
## <class 'tuple'>


# 2
a = (1,)
type(a)
## <class 'tuple'>


# 3
a = 1, 2
type(a)
## <class 'tuple'>


# 4
a = (1)
type(a)
## <class 'int'>


# 5
a = 1,
type(a)
## <class 'tuple'>
```
